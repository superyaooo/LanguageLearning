print "I have so many shoes."

print "leather shoes:", 1.0+3.0  #1.0 and 3.0 are floating numbers.

print "sandles:", 5.0

print "sports shoes:", 3.0

print "how many pairs are there in total?", 1+3+5+3

print "I wear one pair a day, how many pairs are left unworn by the end of the week?", (1+3+5+3)%7.0     # ()here works to bring numbers together.  

# % calculates the remainder/residue.

print "do I have more leather shoes than sandles?", 1+3>5  # the result of this is "true" or "false".
